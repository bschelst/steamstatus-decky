Display **real-time Steam status**, player counts, and Steam service health directly on your lovely Steam Deck. 🚀

The plugin aggregates information from official Steam APIs and ProtonDB through a dedicated gateway server, providing reliable status data without requiring a Steam API key. ⚡

## ✨ What it does

Steam Status Decky is a Decky plugin which displays real-time information about Steam services, helping you know when Steam is experiencing issues. The plugin shows:

- 👥 **Current player count** - Total users currently logged into Steam
- 🟢 **Service status** - Health of Steam Store, Community, and WebAPI
- 📊 **24-hour player history** - Sparkline graph showing player count trends
- 🌍 **Regional server status** - Status of Steam servers by region
- 🔥 **Trending games** - Top 5 Deck-verified games with biggest player gains
- 🚨 **Outage detection** - Automatic detection and notifications for service outages

## 🌐 Gateway & Status Page

This plugin uses a **gateway server** to fetch Steam status data. The gateway aggregates information from official Steam APIs and caches it efficiently, so the plugin doesn't directly hit Steam's servers with every request.

**Why a gateway?**
- Reduces load on Steam's API infrastructure
- Provides consistent, reliable data access
- No Steam API key required for end users
- Enables advanced features like outage tracking and historical data

The gateway is developed, hosted, and maintained by me.

**Live Status Dashboard:** You can view the current Steam status and outage history on the public status page:
🔗 **https://steamstatus.schelstraete.org/status**

## 💡 Why did I create this

In December 2025, we experienced several Steam service outages. During my active gaming session, issues were occuring in-game, without any clear indication that Steam itself was experiencing problems.
At the time, we didn't know whether these disruptions were caused by local issues or by a broader Steam service outage. (You know how it goes..."would a reboot resolve our issues").
This led me to realize that it would be (for me) highly beneficial to receive clear notifications when Steam services are experiencing problems, or to be able to view the current status of Steam directly, without having to interrupt gameplay or open a web browser to investigate the issue.

## 🌐 Translations

The plugin supports localization and will automatically use Steam's language setting.
I used Google translate (is that AI or isn't it..) for the translations, so the translation could be compleeeeetely wrong ;)

Pull requests for new translations are welcome. 🙏
